**Game state** is the in-memory data which describes the state of the game world as it is simulated over time. It differs from [tags](~) which, although they are also [loaded into memory](~map#map-loading), describe static or initial properties of classes of game objects rather than the current properties of individual ones.

Game state also includes global data for systems like [scripting](~) (script globals), multiplayer [game modes](~game-modes) (scores), and [physics](~physics-engine) (game speed and gravity) to name a few.

Most of this data is saved and loaded from [save files](~files#savegame-bin).

# Datum arrays
Much of the game state is maintained in _datum arrays_, also called _tables_. Each entry (_datum_) in these arrays is used to store the current state of some object or effect.

Since the game world is dynamic, the datum count can rise up to a limit. The following limits are known ("-" if unchanged):
